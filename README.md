# Getting started

## Setup

To implement lax you need to create at least one _driver_, to provide values for animations, as well as the element animation bindings. Below is a simple example:

```html
<!-- JS -->
<script>
  window.onload = function() {
    lax.init()

    // Add a driver that we use to control our animations
    lax.addDriver('scrollY', function() {
      return document.body.scrollTop
    })

    // Add animation bindings to elements
    lax.addElements('.selector', {
      scrollY: {
        presets: ['fadeInOut']
      }
    }
  })
</script>

<!-- HTML -->
<div class="selector">Hello</div>
```

## Usage With React, Vue, EmberJS & DOM Changes

To increase performance, `lax.js` indexes the list of elements to animate when the page loads. If you're using a library like React, Vue or EmberJS, it is likely that you are adding elements after the initial window.onload. Because of this you will need to call `lax.addElements` when you add components to the DOM that you want to animate, and `lax.removeElements` when the component unmounts.

- React - use-lax ?
- Vue.js: [TODO]
- Angular.js[TODO]

## Using presets

The easiest way to get started is to use presets. Multiple presets can be chained together and they can be customised to suit your needs. See a full list of presets [here](#presets).

See an example below:

```javascript
lax.addElements('.selector', {
  scrollY: {
    presets: ['fadeInOut', 'scaleInOut 0.2,0.1']
  }
}
```

## Adding drivers

Drivers provide the values that _drive_ your animations. To set up a driver just call `lax.addDriver` with a name and a method which returns a numerical value. This method is called every frame to calculate the animations so keep the method as _light_ as possible. The example below will be the most common use case for lax which returns the scrollY position of the window.

```javascript
lax.addDriver(
  'scrollY',                          // Driver name
  function(laxFrame) {                     
    return document.body.scrollTop    // Value method
  },
  { }                                 // Options
)
```

### Driver options

#### `momentumEnabled: boolean = false`

If enabled, the driver will calculate the speed at which its value is changing. Used to add momentum to elements using the [momentum element option](#momentum-number).

See this in action in the [momentum example](#).

#### `frameStep: number = 1`

By default each driver updates its value every animation frame, around ~60 times per second. You can use the `frameStep` to reduce frequency of the driver value updating. For example a value of `2` would only update ~30 times per second and a value of `60` would only update about once per second.

### Driver examples

[TODO]
Take a look at [examples/drivers](examples/drivers.html) to see more.

## Adding elements

You can add lax animations to an element using JavaScript or inline HTML.

Using the `addElements` method in JavaScript:

```javascript
lax.addElements(
  '.selector',  // Element selector rule
  {             // Animation data
    scrollY: {  
      opacity: [
        [0, 100],
        [1, 0]
      ]
    }
  },
  {             
    style: {}   // Options
  }
)
```

Using inline HTML, use the `data-lax` attribute:

```html
<div
  class="selector"
  data-lax="{
  scrollY: {
    opacity: [
      [0, 100],
      [1, 0]
    ]
  }
}, {}"
></div>
```

### Element options

#### `style: {}`

Add static CSS to each element, for example:

```css
 {
  transform: '200ms scale ease-in-out';
}
```

# Going deeper

## Custom animations

Custom animations are defined using an object.

```javascript
{
  scrollY: {                // Driver name
    translateX: [           // CSS property
      ['elInY', 'elOutY'],  // Driver value map
      [0, 'screenWidth'],   // Animation value map
      {
        momentum: 10        // Options
      }
    ],
    opacity: [
      // etc
    ]
  }
}
```

### Driver name

The name of the driver you want to use as a source of values to map to your animation, for example, the `document`'s scrollY position. Read about adding drivers [here](#adding-drivers).

### CSS property

The name of the CSS property you want to animate, for example `opacity` or `rotate`. See a list of supporter properties [here](#css-properties).

> Some css properties, for example `box-shadow`, require a custom function to build the style string. To do this use the [cssFn](#cssfn-value-number--string) element option.

### Value maps
The value maps are used to interpolate the driver value and output a value for your CSS property. For example:

```javascript
[0, 200, 800]  // Driver map
[0, 10,  20]   // Animation map

// Result

| In  | Out |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   |
| 100 | 5   |
| 200 | 10  |
| 500 | 15  |
| 800 | 20  |
```

Within the maps you can use strings for simple formulas as well as use special values. e.g:

```javascript
['elInY', 'elCenterY-200', 'elCenterY',
```

See a list of available values [here](#special-values).

You can also use mobile breakpoints within animation maps for more flexibility.

```javascript
scrollY: {
  translateX: [
    ['elInY', 'elCenterY', 'elOutY'],
    {
      500: [10, 20, 50], // Screen width < 500
      900: [30, 40, 60], // Screen width > 500 and < 900
      1400: [30, 40, 60], // Screen width > 900
    },
  ];
}
```

### Options

#### `modValue: number | undefined`
Set this option to modulus the value from the driver, for example if you want to loop the animation value as the driver value continues to increase.

#### `frameStep: number = 1`

By default each animation updates its value every animation frame, around ~60 times per second. You can use the `frameStep` to reduce frequency of the animation updating. For example a value of `2` would only update ~30 times per second and a value of `60` would only update about once per second.

#### `momentum: number`

[TODO]
See momentum in action [here](https://codesandbox.io/embed/lax-examples-momentum-tisoc?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview).

#### `momentumMode: "normal" | "absolute"`

Use in combination with `momentum`. If set to `absolute` the momentum value will always be a positive number via the `Math.abs` operator.

#### cssUnit: string = ""

[TODO]

#### round

[TODO]

#### `cssFn: (value: number) => string`

Some CSS properties require more complex strings as values. For example, `box-shadow` has multiple values that could be modified by a lax animation.

```javascript
// Box-shadow example
(val) => {
  return `${val}px ${val}px ${val}px rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`;
};
```
